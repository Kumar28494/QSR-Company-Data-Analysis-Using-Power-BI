# Project Report: QSR Company Data Analysis Using Power BI
## Project Name: QSR Company Data Set Analysis
### Tools Used: Excel, Power BI

# 1. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the data of a Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) company using Power BI. The goal was to prepare the data for insights, perform KPI and performance analysis, and visualize the findings effectively using various charts. We also conducted cost analysis, SKU-level turnover analysis, budgeting analysis, and used advanced techniques like Mekko charts, quadrant analysis, Pareto analysis, and PVM analysis.

# 2. Data Preparation
The raw data from the QSR company was first cleaned and structured in Excel. We then created two types of tables:

## Dimension Tables: These tables contain descriptive attributes such as product details, region, and customer information.
## Fact Tables: These tables include numerical and transactional data, such as sales, costs, and revenue.
After structuring the data, we imported it into Power BI and developed a data model by establishing relationships between the dimension and fact tables. This helped in organizing the data for meaningful insights and making it easier to perform analysis.

# 3. Data Modeling and Relationship Development
A key part of the project was to design an efficient data model by linking the fact tables to the dimension tables using primary and foreign keys. The relationships allowed for a smooth flow of data, enabling more accurate insights across different parameters like time, product category, and region.

# 4. Key Metrics and Performance Analysis
We created various KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to measure performance across different aspects of the business. These KPIs include:

## Sales revenue by SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
## Total cost and profit margin
## Budgeting variance
## SKU-level turnover rate
# 5. Visualizations and Analysis
Using Power BI, we developed the following visualizations to gain insights:

## Column and Pie Charts: For an overview of sales, revenue, and cost distribution across different regions and SKUs.
## Cost Analysis: We used various charts to identify cost trends, pinpoint high-cost areas, and analyze how costs relate to SKU-level turnover.
## SKU-Level Turnover Analysis: A detailed analysis of SKU performance to find high-performing and low-performing products.
## Budgeting Analysis: Using variance charts to compare budgeted vs. actual financial performance.
## Mekko Charts: For visualizing the market share of different products and services.
## Quadrant Analysis: To categorize products based on performance metrics and find strategic focus areas.
## Pareto Analysis: Identified the 80/20 rule, where 80% of the sales came from 20% of the products.
## Pareto Final: Focused on top-performing SKUs for further strategy development.
## PVM (Price-Volume-Mix) Analysis: This helped break down revenue changes into price, volume, and product mix components.
## Variance Analysis: Used to track performance against goals and understand deviations.
# 6. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the power of using Power BI and Excel for data preparation, modeling, and visualization. We were able to draw valuable insights through various analytical techniques, helping the QSR company make informed decisions related to cost optimization, product performance, and budgeting.
